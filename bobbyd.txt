Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love
Honey baby, I can stand

I been meek
And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me
Honey baby, I'll be near

<<<<<<< HEAD
I like your smile
And your fingertips
Like the way that you move your hips
I like the long way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me mystery
=======
I love your smile
And your toetips
Like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me mystery

Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I'm takin' you with me
Honey baby, when I go
